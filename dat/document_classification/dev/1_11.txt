Meanwhile Trumpkin and the two boys arrived at the dark little stone archway which led into the inside of the Mound , and two sentinel badgers ( the white patches on their cheeks were all Edmund could see of them ) leaped up with bared teeth and asked them in snarling voices , " Who goes there ? "
" Trumpkin , " said the Dwarf .
" Bringing the High King of Narnia out of the far past . "
The badgers nosed at the boys ' hands .
" At last , " they said .
" At last . "
" Give us a light , friends , " said Trumpkin .
The badgers found a torch just inside the arch and Peter lit it and handed it to Trumpkin .
" The D.L.F. had better lead , " he said .
" We do n't know our way about this place . "
Trumpkin took the torch and went ahead into the dark tunnel .
It was a cold , black , musty place , with an occasional bat fluttering in the torchlight , and plenty of cobwebs .
The boys , who had been mostly in the open air since that morning at the railway station , felt as if they were going into a trap or a prison .
" I say , Peter , " whispered Edmund .
" Look at those carvings on the walls .
Do n't they look old ?
And yet we 're older than that .
When we were last here , they had n't been made . "
" Yes , " said Peter .
" That makes one think . "
The Dwarf went on ahead and then turned to the right , and then to the left , and then down some steps , and then to the left again .
Then at last they saw a light ahead -- light from under a door .
And now for the first time they heard voices , for they had come to the door of the central chamber .
The voices inside were angry ones .
Someone was talking so loudly that the approach of the boys and the Dwarf had not been heard .
" Do n't like the sound of that , " whispered Trumpkin to Peter .
" Let 's listen for a moment . "
All three stood perfectly still on the outside of the door .
" You know well enough , " said a voice ( " That 's the King , " whispered Trumpkin ) , " why the Horn was not blown at sunrise that morning .
Have you forgotten that Miraz fell upon us almost before Trumpkin had gone , and we were fighting for our lives for the space of three hours and more ?
I blew it when first I had a breathing space . "
" I 'm not likely to forget it , " came the angry voice , " when my Dwarfs bore the brunt of the attack and one in five of them fell . "
( " That 's Nikabrik , " whispered Trumpkin . )
" For shame , Dwarf , " came a thick voice ( " Trufflehunter 's , " said Trumpkin ) .
" We all did as much as the Dwarfs and none more than the King . "
" Tell that tale your own way for all I care , " answered Nikabrik .
" But whether it was that the Horn was blown too late , or whether there was no magic in it , no help has come .
You , you great clerk , you master magician , you know - all ; are you still asking us to hang our hopes on Aslan and King Peter and all the rest of it ? "
" I must confess -- I can not deny it -- that I am deeply disappointed in the result of the operation , " came the answer .
( " That 'll be Doctor Cornelius , " said Trumpkin . )
" To speak plainly , " said Nikabrik , " your wallet 's empty , your eggs addled , your fish uncaught , your promises broken .
Stand aside then and let others work .
And that is why ---- "
" The help will come , " said Trufflehunter .
" I stand by Aslan .
Have patience , like us beasts .
The help will come .
It may be even now at the door . "
" Pah ! " snarled Nikabrik .
" You badgers would have us wait till the sky falls and we can all catch larks .
I tell you we ca n't wait .
Food is running short ; we lose more than we can afford at every encounter ; our followers are slipping away . "
" And why ? " asked Trufflehunter .
" I 'll tell you why .
Because it is noised among them that we have called on the Kings of old and the Kings of old have not answered .
The last words Trumpkin spoke before he went ( and went , most likely , to his death ) were , ' If you must blow the Horn , do not let the army know why you blow it or what you hope from it .
' But that same evening everyone seemed to know . "
" You 'd better have shoved your grey snout in a hornets ' nest , Badger , than suggest that I am the blab , " said Nikabrik .
" Take it back , or ---- "
" Oh , stop it , both of you , " said King Caspian .
" I want to know what it is that Nikabrik keeps on hinting we should do .
But before that , I want to know who those two strangers are whom he has brought into our council and who stand there with their ears open and their mouths shut . "
" They are friends of mine , " said Nikabrik .
" And what better right have you yourself to be here than that you are a friend of Trumpkin 's and the Badger 's ?
And what right has that old dotard in the black gown to be here except that he is your friend ?
Why am I to be the only one who ca n't bring in his friends ? "
" His Majesty is the King to whom you have sworn allegiance , " said Trufflehunter sternly .
" Court manners , court manners , " sneered Nikabrik .
" But in this hole we may talk plainly .
You know -- and he knows -- that this Telmarine boy will be king of nowhere and nobody in a week unless we can help him out of the trap in which he sits . "
" Perhaps , " said Cornelius , " your new friends would like to speak for themselves ?
You there , who and what are you ? "
" Worshipful Master Doctor , " came a thin , whining voice .
" So please you , I 'm only a poor old woman , I am , and very obliged to his Worshipful Dwarfship for his friendship , I 'm sure .
His Majesty , bless his handsome face , has no need to be afraid of an old woman that 's nearly doubled up with the rheumatics and has n't two sticks to put under her kettle .
I have some poor little skill -- not like yours , Master Doctor , of course -- in small spells and cantrips that I 'd be glad to use against our enemies if it was agreeable to all concerned .
For I hate 'em .
Oh yes .
No one hates better than me . "
" That is all most interesting and -- er -- satisfactory , " said Doctor Cornelius .
" I think I now know what you are , Madam .
Perhaps your other friend , Nikabrik , would give some account of himself ? "
A dull , grey voice at which Peter 's flesh crept replied , " I 'm hunger .
I 'm thirst .
Where I bite , I hold till I die , and even after death they must cut out my mouthful from my enemy 's body and bury it with me .
I can fast a hundred years and not die .
I can lie a hundred nights on the ice and not freeze .
I can drink a river of blood and not burst .
Show me your enemies . "
" And it is in the presence of these two that you wish to disclose your plan ? " said Caspian .
" Yes , " said Nikabrik .
" And by their help that I mean to execute it . "
There was a minute or two during which Trumpkin and the boys could hear Caspian and his two friends speaking in low voices but could not make out what they were saying .
Then Caspian spoke aloud .
" Well , Nikabrik , " he said , " we will hear your plan . "
There was a pause so long that the boys began to wonder if Nikabrik was ever going to begin ; when he did , it was in a lower voice , as if he himself did not much like what he was saying .
" All said and done , " he muttered , " none of us knows the truth about the ancient days in Narnia .
Trumpkin believed none of the stories .
I was ready to put them to the trial .
We tried first the Horn and it has failed .
If there ever was a High King Peter and a Queen Susan and a King Edmund and a Queen Lucy , then either they have not heard us , or they can not come , or they are our enemies ---- "
" Or they are on the way , " put in Trufflehunter .
" You can go on saying that till Miraz has fed us all to his dogs .
As I was saying , we have tried one link in the chain of old legends , and it has done us no good .
Well .
But when your sword breaks , you draw your dagger .
The stories tell of other powers beside the ancient Kings and Queens .
How if we could call _them_ up ? "
" If you mean Aslan , " said Trufflehunter , " it 's all one calling on him and on the Kings .
They were his servants .
If he will not send them ( but I make no doubt he will ) , is he more likely to come himself ? "
" No .
You 're right there , " said Nikabrik .
" Aslan and the Kings go together .
Either Aslan is dead , or he is not on our side .
Or else something stronger than himself keeps him back .
And if he did come -- how do we know he 'd be our friend ?
He was not always a good friend to Dwarfs by all that 's told .
Not even to all beasts .
Ask the Wolves .
And anyway , he was in Narnia only once that I ever heard of , and he did n't stay long .
You may drop Aslan out of the reckoning .
I was thinking of someone else . "
There was no answer , and for a few minutes it was so still that Edmund could hear the wheezy and snuffling breath of the Badger .
" Who do you mean ? " said Caspian at last .
" I mean a power so much greater than Aslan 's that it held Narnia spellbound for years and years , if the stories are true . "
" The White Witch ! " cried three voices all at once , and from the noise Peter guessed that three people had leaped to their feet .
" Yes , " said Nikabrik very slowly and distinctly , " I mean the Witch .
Sit down again .
Do n't all take fright at a name as if you were children .
We want power : and we want a power that will be on our side .
As for power , do not the stories say that the Witch defeated Aslan , and bound him , and killed him on that very stone which is over there , just beyond the light ? "
" But they also say that he came to life again , " said the Badger sharply .
" Yes , they _say_ , " answered Nikabrik , " but you 'll notice that we hear precious little about anything he did afterwards .
He just fades out of the story .
How do you explain that , if he really came to life ?
Is n't it much more likely that he did n't , and that the stories say nothing more about him because there was nothing more to say ? "
" He established the Kings and Queens , " said Caspian .
" A King who has just won a great battle can usually establish himself without the help of a performing lion , " said Nikabrik .
There was a fierce growl , probably from Trufflehunter .
" And anyway , " Nikabrik continued , " what came of the Kings and their reign ?
They faded too .
But it 's very different with the Witch .
They say she ruled for a hundred years : a hundred years of winter .
There 's power , if you like .
There 's something practical . "
" But , heaven and earth ! " said the King , " have n't we always been told that she was the worst enemy of all ?
Was n't she a tyrant ten times worse than Miraz ? "
" Perhaps , " said Nikabrik in a cold voice .
" Perhaps she was for you humans , if there were any of you in those days .
Perhaps she was for some of the beasts .
She stamped out the Beavers , I dare say ; at least there are none of them in Narnia now .
But she got on all right with us Dwarfs .
I 'm a Dwarf and I stand by my own people .
_We're_ not afraid of the Witch . "
" But you 've joined with us , " said Trufflehunter .
" Yes , and a lot of good it has done my people , so far , " snapped Nikabrik .
" Who is sent on all the dangerous raids ?
The Dwarfs .
Who goes short when the rations fail ?
The Dwarfs .
Who ---- "
" Lies !
All lies ! " said the Badger .
" And so , " said Nikabrik , whose voice now rose to a scream , " if you ca n't help my people , I 'll go to someone who can . "
" Is this open treason , Dwarf ? " asked the King .
" Put that sword back in its sheath , Caspian , " said Nikabrik .
" Murder at council , eh ?
Is that your game ?
Do n't be fool enough to try it .
Do you think I 'm afraid of you ?
There 's three on my side , and three on yours . "
" Come on , then , " snarled Trufflehunter , but he was immediately interrupted .
" Stop , stop , stop , " said Doctor Cornelius .
" You go on too fast .
The Witch is dead .
All the stories agree on that .
What does Nikabrik mean by calling on the Witch ? "
That grey and terrible voice which had spoken only once before said , " Oh , _is_ she ? "
And then the shrill , whining voice began , " Oh , bless his heart , his dear little Majesty need n't mind about the White Lady -- that 's what _we_ call her -- being dead .
The Worshipful Master Doctor is only making game of a poor old woman like me when he says that .
Sweet Master Doctor , learned Master Doctor , who ever heard of a witch that really died ?
You can always get them back . "
" Call her up , " said the grey voice .
" We are all ready .
Draw the circle .
Prepare the blue fire . "
Above the steadily increasing growl of the Badger and Cornelius 's sharp " What ? " rose the voice of King Caspian like thunder .
" So that is your plan , Nikabrik !
Black sorcery and the calling up of an accursed ghost .
And I see who your companions are -- a Hag and a Wer - Wolf ! "
The next minute or so was very confused .
There was an animal roaring , a clash of steel ; the boys and Trumpkin rushed in ; Peter had a glimpse of a horrible , grey , gaunt creature , half man and half wolf , in the very act of leaping upon a boy about his own age , and Edmund saw a badger and a Dwarf rolling on the floor in a sort of cat fight .
Trumpkin found himself face to face with the Hag .
Her nose and chin stuck out like a pair of nut - crackers , her dirty grey hair was flying about her face and she had just got Doctor Cornelius by the throat .
At one slash of Trumpkin 's sword her head rolled on the floor .
Then the light was knocked over and it was all swords , teeth , claws , fists and boots for about sixty seconds .
Then silence .
" Are you all right , Ed ? "
" I -- I think so , " panted Edmund .
" I 've got that brute Nikabrik , but he 's still alive . "
" Weights and water - bottles ! " came an angry voice .
" It 's _me_ you 're sitting on .
Get off .
You 're like a young elephant . "
" Sorry , D.L.F. , " said Edmund .
" Is that better ? "
" Ow !
No ! " bellowed Trumpkin .
" You 're putting your boot in my mouth .
Go away . "
" Is King Caspian anywhere ? " asked Peter .
" I 'm here , " said a rather faint voice .
" Something bit me . "
They all heard the noise of someone striking a match .
It was Edmund .
The little flame showed his face , looking pale and dirty .
He blundered about for a little , found the candle ( they were no longer using the lamp , for they had run out of oil ) , set it on the table and lit it .
When the flame rose clear , several people scrambled to their feet .
Six faces blinked at one another in the candlelight .
" We do n't seem to have any enemies left , " said Peter .
" There 's the Hag , dead . "
( He turned his eyes quickly away from her . )
" And Nikabrik , dead too .
And I suppose this thing is a Wer - Wolf .
It 's so long since I 've seen one .
Wolf 's head and man 's body .
That means he was just turning from man into wolf at the moment he was killed .
And you , I suppose , are King Caspian ? "
" Yes , " said the other boy .
" But I 've no idea who you are . "
" It 's the High King , King Peter , " said Trumpkin .
" Your Majesty is very welcome , " said Caspian .
" And so is _your_ Majesty , " said Peter .
" I have n't come to take your place , you know , but to put you into it . "
" Your Majesty , " said another voice at Peter 's elbow .
He turned and found himself face to face with the Badger .
Peter leaned forward , put his arms round the beast and kissed the furry head : it was n't a girlish thing for him to do , because he was the High King .
" Best of badgers , " he said .
" You never doubted us all through . "
" No credit to me , your Majesty , " said Trufflehunter .
" I 'm a beast and we do n't change .
I 'm a badger , what 's more , and we hold on . "
" I am sorry for Nikabrik , " said Caspian , " though he hated me from the first moment he saw me .
He had gone sour inside from long suffering and hating .
If we had won quickly he might have become a good Dwarf in the days of peace .
I do n't know which of us killed him .
I 'm glad of that . "
" You 're bleeding , " said Peter .
" Yes , I 'm bitten , " said Caspian .
" It was that -- that wolf thing . "
Cleaning and bandaging the wound took a little time , and when it was done Trumpkin said , " Now .
Before everything else we want some breakfast . "
" But not here , " said Peter .
" No , " said Caspian with a shudder .
" And we must send someone to take away the bodies . "
" Let the vermin be flung into a pit , " said Peter .
" But the Dwarf we will give to his people to be buried in their own fashion . "
They breakfasted at last in another of the dark cellars of Aslan 's How .
It was not such a breakfast as they would have chosen , for Caspian and Cornelius were thinking of venison pasties , and Peter and Edmund of buttered eggs and hot coffee , but what everyone got was a little bit of cold bear - meat ( out of the boys ' pockets ) , a lump of hard cheese , an onion , and a mug of water .
But , from the way they fell to , anyone would have supposed it was delicious .
