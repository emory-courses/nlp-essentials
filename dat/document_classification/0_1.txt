" Good evening , " said Lucy .
But the Faun was so busy picking up his parcels that at first he did not reply .
When he had finished he made her a little bow .
" Good evening , good evening , " said the Faun .
" Excuse me -- I do n't want to be inquisitive -- but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve ? "
" My name 's Lucy , " said she , not quite understanding him .
" But you are -- forgive me -- you are what they call a girl ? " asked the Faun .
" Of course I 'm a girl , " said Lucy .
" You are in fact Human ? "
" Of course I 'm human , " said Lucy , still a little puzzled .
" To be sure , to be sure , " said the Faun .
" How stupid of me !
But I 've never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before .
I am delighted .
That is to say -- " and then he stopped as if he had been going to say something he had not intended but had remembered in time .
" Delighted , delighted , " he went on .
" Allow me to introduce myself .
My name is Tumnus . "
" I am very pleased to meet you , Mr. Tumnus , " said Lucy .
" And may I ask , O Lucy , Daughter of Eve , " said Mr. Tumnus , " how you have come into Narnia ? "
" Narnia ?
What 's that ? " said Lucy .
" This is the land of Narnia , " said the Faun , " where we are now ; all that lies between the lamp - post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea .
And you -- you have come from the wild woods of the west ? "
" I -- I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room , " said Lucy .
" Ah ! " said Mr. Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice , " if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun , I should no doubt know all about those strange countries .
It is too late now . "
" But they are n't countries at all , " said Lucy , almost laughing .
" It 's only just back there -- at least -- I 'm not sure .
It is summer there . "
" Meanwhile , " said Mr. Tumnus , " it is winter in Narnia , and has been for ever so long , and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow .
Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe , how would it be if you came and had tea with me ? "
" Thank you very much , Mr. Tumnus , " said Lucy .
" But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back . "
" It 's only just round the corner , " said the Faun , " and there 'll be a roaring fire -- and toast -- and sardines -- and cake . "
" Well , it 's very kind of you , " said Lucy .
" But I sha n't be able to stay long . "
" If you will take my arm , Daughter of Eve , " said Mr. Tumnus , " I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of us .
That 's the way .
Now -- off we go . "
And so Lucy found herself walking through the wood arm in arm with this strange creature as if they had known one another all their lives .
They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down .
At the bottom of one small valley Mr. Tumnus turned suddenly aside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock , but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave .
As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire .
Then Mr. Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs , and lit a lamp .
" Now we sha n't be long , " he said , and immediately put a kettle on .
Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place .
It was a little , dry , clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs ( " one for me and one for a friend , " said Mr. Tumnus ) and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard .
In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr. Tumnus ' bedroom , and on one wall was a shelf full of books .
Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things .
They had titles like _The Life and Letters of Silenus_ or _Nymphs and Their Ways_ or _Men , Monks and Gamekeepers ; a Study in Popular Legend_ or _Is Man a Myth_ ?
" Now , Daughter of Eve ! " said the Faun .
And really it was a wonderful tea .
There was a nice brown egg , lightly boiled , for each of them , and then sardines on toast , and then buttered toast , and then toast with honey , and then a sugar - topped cake .
And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk .
He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest .
He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns ; about long hunting parties after the milk - white Stag who could give you wishes if you caught him ; about feasting and treasure - seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor ; and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them , and sometimes Bacchus himself , and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end .
" Not that it is n't always winter now , " he added gloomily .
Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play .
And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time .
It must have been hours later when she shook herself and said ,
" Oh Mr. Tumnus -- I 'm so sorry to stop you , and I do love that tune -- but really , I must go home .
I only meant to stay for a few minutes . "
" It 's no good _now_ , you know , " said the Faun , laying down his flute and shaking his head at her very sorrowfully .
" No good ? " said Lucy , jumping up and feeling rather frightened .
" What do you mean ?
I 've got to go home at once .
The others will be wondering what has happened to me . "
But a moment later she asked , " Mr. Tumnus !
Whatever is the matter ? " for the Faun 's brown eyes had filled with tears and then the tears began trickling down his cheeks , and soon they were running off the end of his nose ; and at last he covered his face with his hands and began to howl .
" Mr. Tumnus !
Mr. Tumnus ! " said Lucy in great distress .
" Do n't !
Do n't !
What is the matter ?
Are n't you well ?
Dear Mr. Tumnus , do tell me what is wrong . "
But the Faun continued sobbing as if his heart would break .
And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her handkerchief , he did not stop .
He merely took the handkerchief and kept on using it , wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use , so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch .
" Mr. Tumnus ! " bawled Lucy in his ear , shaking him .
" Do stop .
Stop it at once !
You ought to be ashamed of yourself , a great big Faun like you .
What on earth are you crying about ? "
" Oh -- oh -- oh ! " sobbed Mr. Tumnus , " I 'm crying because I 'm such a bad Faun . "
" I do n't think you 're a bad Faun at all , " said Lucy .
" I think you are a very good Faun .
You are the nicest Faun I 've ever met . "
" Oh -- oh -- you would n't say that if you knew , " replied Mr. Tumnus between his sobs .
" No , I 'm a bad Faun .
I do n't suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world . "
" But what have you done ? " asked Lucy .
" My old father , now , " said Mr. Tumnus , " that 's his picture over the mantelpiece .
He would never have done a thing like this . "
" A thing like what ? " said Lucy .
" Like what I 've done , " said the Faun .
" Taken service under the White Witch .
That 's what I am .
I 'm in the pay of the White Witch . "
" The White Witch ?
Who is she ? "
" Why , it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb .
It 's she that makes it always winter .
Always winter and never Christmas ; think of that ! "
" How awful ! " said Lucy .
" But what does she pay you for ? "
" That 's the worst of it , " said Mr. Tumnus with a deep groan .
" I 'm a kidnapper for her , that 's what I am .
Look at me , Daughter of Eve .
Would you believe that I 'm the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood , one that had never done me any harm , and pretend to be friendly with it , and invite it home to my cave , all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch ? "
" No , " said Lucy .
" I 'm sure you would n't do anything of the sort . "
" But I have , " said the Faun .
" Well , " said Lucy rather slowly ( for she wanted to be truthful and yet not to be too hard on him ) , " well , that was pretty bad .
But you 're so sorry for it that I 'm sure you will never do it again . "
" Daughter of Eve , do n't you understand ? " said the Faun .
" It is n't something I _have_ done .
I 'm doing it now , this very moment . "
" What do you mean ? " cried Lucy , turning very white .
" You are the child , " said Mr. Tumnus .
" I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood , I was to catch them and hand them over to her .
And you are the first I ever met .
And I 've pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea , and all the time I 've been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell _her_ . "
" Oh but you wo n't , Mr. Tumnus , " said Lucy .
" You wo n't , will you ?
Indeed , indeed you really must n't . "
" And if I do n't , " said he , beginning to cry again , " she 's sure to find out .
And she 'll have my tail cut off , and my horns sawn off , and my beard plucked out , and she 'll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like a wretched horse 's .
And if she is extra and specially angry she 'll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled -- and goodness knows when that will happen , or whether it will ever happen at all . "
" I 'm very sorry , Mr. Tumnus , " said Lucy .
" But please let me go home . "
" Of course I will , " said the Faun .
" Of course I 've got to .
I see that now .
I had n't known what Humans were like before I met you .
Of course I ca n't give you up to the Witch ; not now that I know you .
But we must be off at once .
I 'll see you back to the lamp - post .
I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe ? "
" I 'm sure I can , " said Lucy .
" We must go as quietly as we can , " said Mr. Tumnus .
" The whole wood is full of _her_ spies .
Even some of the trees are on her side . "
They both got up and left the tea things on the table , and Mr. Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm , and they went out into the snow .
The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun 's cave ; they stole along as quickly as they could , without speaking a word , and Mr. Tumnus kept to the darkest places .
Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp - post again .
" Do you know your way from here , Daughter of Eve ? " said Tumnus .
Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight .
" Yes , " she said , " I can see the wardrobe door . "
" Then be off home as quick as you can , " said the Faun , " and -- c - can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do ? "
" Why , of course I can , " said Lucy , shaking him heartily by the hand .
" And I do hope you wo n't get into dreadful trouble on my account . "
" Farewell , Daughter of Eve , " said he .
" Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief ? "
" Rather ! " said Lucy , and then ran towards the far - off patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would carry her .
And presently instead of rough branches brushing past her she felt coats , and instead of crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden boards , and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started .
She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around , panting for breath .
It was still raining and she could hear the voices of the others in the passage .
" I 'm here , " she shouted .
" I 'm here .
I 've come back , I 'm all right . "
