# Speed Dating

During this class hour, you will have the opportunity to meet your classmates in a series of brief, focused conversations. The goal is to identify potential teammates whose research interests and skills complement your own. This is not about finding your exact clone, but rather discovering peers whose strengths and passions could contribute to a well-rounded and dynamic project team.

Be concise, be curious, and most importantly, be yourself. After this session, you will have 2.5 weeks to form a team for collaboration on a team project.

## Process

* You will participate in 7 rounds of speed dating, with each round lasting 8 minutes and 2-minute transition time between rounds.
* During each round:
  * Form a group of three people with classmates.
  * Each person gets 2 minutes to present and answer questions (6 minutes total).
  * Use the remaining 2 minutes for mutual discussion and note-taking.
* After each round, split up and form new groups with people you have npt met yet.
* By the end of the session, you will have met approximately 14 different classmates (about 25% of the class), helping you identify potential teammates that complement your skills and interests.

Make the most of each interaction by being concise about your interests and skills while asking thoughtful questions to understand your classmates' strengths and working styles.
