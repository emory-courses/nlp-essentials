# Team Formation

Following our Project Ideas submissions and [Speed Dating](speed-dating) session, it is time to form your project teams. Each team will consist of 3-4 members.

## Formation

1. Review project ideas from your classmates. Consider which projects align with your interests and skills.
2. Reflect on your interactions during the speed dating session. Think about:
   * Who shared complementary skills to yours?
   * Which classmates did you communicate well with?
   * Whose working style seemed compatible with yours?

## Submission

Connect with your classmates to discuss potential collaboration. Once you have formed a complete team of 3-4 members, submit your team composition to Canvas: `[People] > [Teams #]`.

* Contact the instructor if you want to form a team of 5 members. While teams of 3-4 are preferred to prevent free riding, exceptions may be considered with justification.
* If you're having difficulty finding a team, please reach out to the instructor at least a week before the deadline.
