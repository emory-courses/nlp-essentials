# Live Demonstration

Your team will participate in an interactive demonstration session where you will present your final project to multiple groups of classmates. The session will follow a rotation format, with each team hosting their station while other students move between presentations in 10-minute intervals.

## Logistics

* Time per rotation: 10 minutes (5 minutes presentation + 5 minutes interaction).
* Format: Station-based demonstrations using your laptop.
* Audience: 6-7 different groups will visit your station.

## Preparation

### Technical Setup

* Ensure your laptop is fully charged and bring your charger.
* Test all features of your project thoroughly.
* Prepare a backup plan (e.g., screenshots, video recording) in case of technical issues.
* Have all necessary software installed and running properly.

### Demonstration Script

Create a concise 5-minute presentation that includes:

* Project overview.
* Key features and functionality.
* Technical highlights or innovative solutions.
* Implementation challenges and solutions.
* Future improvements or extensions.

### Interactive Component

Prepare for the 5-minute interaction period:

* Design 2-3 hands-on activities for visitors to try.
* Create a clear set of instructions for each interactive element.
* Prepare sample data or test scenarios that showcase different aspects of your project.
* Consider potential questions and prepare concise answers.

## Submission

Create a 5-10 minute video demonstrating your system and submit it to Canvas
